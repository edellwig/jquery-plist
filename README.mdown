# jQuery.plist
# Synopsis

`$.plist(xml)`

# Description

jQuery.plist deserializes a subset of Mac OS X XML property lists. The return
value is generally what you would expect, although `<data>` nodes currently
raise an exception. Uncommon cases such as property lists with a non-`<dict>`
root object work correctly. Date parsing may not.
